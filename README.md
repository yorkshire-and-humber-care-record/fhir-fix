# What is FHIR Fix?

FHIR Fix is a utility for fixing and manipulation of data in a FHIR Store. Use Cases include:

**1. Data Fixing**

**2. Retention Management**

Internally FHIR Fix uses the same technologies (node.js, docker) as Interweave Connect and so it is a natural companion which can be installed alongside Interweave Connect. However this is in no way a pre-requisite, and FHIR Fix can also be used as a stand-alone utility and can connect to ANY FHIR compliant endpoint.
